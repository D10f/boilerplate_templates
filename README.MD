### Choose your configuration for your next project

The `src` folder contains the basic `html`, `scss` and `js` files and structure to get started. Choose which boilerplate configuration to use (this will be updated over time) and extract those files along with `src`, deleting other configuration folders not in use. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
